- 👋 Hi, I’m @SnakeSpeak
- 👀 I’m interested in Boxing, Voice Acting, Singing, and Personal Interaction
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Python for Data Analysis
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving my code creation skills and solving problems using Python
- 📫 How to reach me: A message to me on here, or by carrier pigeon. I prefer the former, due to my fear of birds.
