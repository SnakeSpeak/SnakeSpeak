- 👋 Hi, I’m @SnakeSpeak
- 👀 I'd love to learn more about Penetration testing and Cybersecurity, along with advancements (and tales of caution) of AI.
- 🌱 Recently graduated the UCI Data Analytics Bootcamp, and still refining my Python and SQL skills, along with Machine Learning.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on improving my code creation skills and solving problems using Python
- 📫 How to reach me: A message to me on here, email me at emagpantay3@gmail.com or by carrier pigeon. I prefer the former two, due to my fear of birds.
